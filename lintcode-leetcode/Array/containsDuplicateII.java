/** this question is not about the maximum of absolute difference between i, j, 
 *  but instead it is about whether there are two indexes i, j with nums[i] == nums[j] and abs(i - j) <= k. 
 *  For example, the input is [1, 0, 1, 1], nums[2] = 1, nums[3] = 1, thus i, j = 2, 3 and abs(i- j) <=1. 
 *  There exist two indexes match the requirements, thus the output is true.
