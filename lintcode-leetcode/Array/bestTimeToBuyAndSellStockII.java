/** 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II (lintcode)/122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II(leetcode)
 *    Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
 *    Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. 
 *    You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
 *  
 *    Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
 *
 *    Example: Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]; Output: 7
 *        Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
