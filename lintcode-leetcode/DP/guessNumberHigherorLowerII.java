/** 375. Guess Number Higher or Lower II(leetcode) / 666. Guess Number Higher or Lower II(lintcode)
 *      We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
 *      I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
 *      Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.
 *      However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you 
 *   guess the number I picked.
 *
 *      Example: n = 10, I pick 8.
 *                First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
 *                Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
 *                Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.
 *               Game over. 8 is the number I picked.
 *
 *                You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
 *          Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.
